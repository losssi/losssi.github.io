**[Oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) is a shell and platform agnostic prompt utility for cool terminal usage.**

***Time: 5min***

## 1 Make local directory in home

Installing for user, not root

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

## 2 Install oh-my-posh to local directory

```shell
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- -d ~/.local/bin
```

## 3 Edit .zshrc or .bashrc or whatever your shell has

Add these lines in the end

```shell
export PATH="/$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh --config /home/user/themes/sometheme.omp.json)"
```

Replace ***zsh*** with your shell, ***user*** with your username and ***sometheme*** with your chosen [theme](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes).

## 4 Activate your new oh-my-posh prompt

```shell
exec zsh
```
or
```shell
source ~./bashrc
```
or whatever your shell uses

Or log out and back in.
