Afaik there are two ways to deal with Nextcloud Android synchronization client using over 50 GB (for me) space on phone.

1. Disable Instant Upload
2. Delete data and log back to Nextcloud

The first is not an option for me, so I **_periodically delete the data_**:

1. Settings > About device > Storage > Apps > Nextcloud > Manage space > Clear data
2. Log back in Nextcloud from the app
3. Re-enable Auto upload and Backups from settings
4. Check that you're still logged in your Nextcloud apps like Bookmarks and News etc.
