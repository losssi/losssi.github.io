title: Workaround for Nextcloud Android Client Hogging Space

Afaik there are two ways to deal with Nextcloud Android client reserving over 50 GB (for me) space on phone.

1. Disable Instant Upload
2. Delete data and log back to Nextcloud

The first is not an option for me, so I **_periodically delete the data_**:

1. Settings > About device > Storage > Apps > Nextcloud > Manage space > Clear data
2. Log back in Nextcloud from the app
